## Description

this is a readme generator. I used the inquirer npm to generate the questions in the prompt and a write to file function to render it. The goal was to automate the creation of readme file generations. In this project I learned a lot about badges, table of contents, and npm in general. Some of the challenges was the markdown function generation and rednering the license.

## Installation

you will need to install inthe inquirer npm to run this program.
